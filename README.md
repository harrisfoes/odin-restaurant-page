# odin-restaurant-page
Restaurant page for the Odin Project course

URL: https://harrisfoes.github.io/odin-restaurant-page/

# Requirements:
- Use webpack
- Implement DOM elements using JavaScript only
- Separate these elements into modules


# Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Webpack

# Post Mortem
- First time using webpack but not that much opportunity to use it's array of features (which might count as a good thing since webpack in its current state is convoluted IMO)
- First time using modules and multiple JavaScript files in a project 
- Implementation is a little rushed and we did not use Classes/Objects. Just breezed through it since I expect the difficulty to ramp up in the next project of the course
